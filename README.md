# US-births
Analysis of US births conducted in Python. Project part of CareerFoundry data analytics course.
# Objective
The purpose of this project was to source a data set of my own choice and utilize Python to analyze key questions. 

The objective of this analysis is to identify if variables such as age of mother, education of mother and location impact the number of births in the United States.
# Data
The US Births 2016-2021 data set is sourced from Kraggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births. The data set has counts of live births occuring within the United States, among a variety of demographic characteristics such as state of residence, mother's age, mother's education level, birth weight and birth gender. 

This data set was originally sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionon (CDCâ€™s) retrieval tool on the CDC Natality page: https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-current.html

More information about the source and data can be found here: https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality-expanded.html

Data Limitations include:
1. The data only contains births from 2016-2021
2. The data contained a limited number of variables upon which to conduct the analysis
